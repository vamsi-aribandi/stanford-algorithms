Code I wrote for first 3 out of 4 Stanford algorithms MOOCs on coursera.org
All programs were written in python 3.

## Some details
All weeks of all courses here will have the relevent, working code for the programming assignments.
Some extra code(not required for programming assignments, but taught in lectures) is also present.
All code was tested with python 3.6.1

## Test cases
All programs have a test case file as well as a file containing the answer(s) to that test case.
All test cases have been taken from the sources below, with the names of the files modified by me.

### Test case sources:

* [course-2 discussion forums](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-graphs-data-structures/discussions)
